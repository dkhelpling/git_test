                <h2>Rocket League</h2>
                <p>Rocket League is quite honestly the best sports game on the market currently.
                    It's not actually a sport, but more of a fusion of soccer, hockey, and racing.
                    The best thing about this game is the gradual curve of getting better.
                    This game rewards you for playing by increasing both your control and timing of car. 
                    Rocket League has been the consistent competitve game in my rotation for the last few years.
                    Based on the excitement and joy the competitive mode brings me, I doubt I'll stop playing in the years to come.</p>

                <h2>Battlefield Bad Company 2</h2>
                <p>Battlefield Bad Company 2 is the second installment in the Bad Company lineup for the long running battlefield series.
                    Having come out on the xbox 360 generation of consoles, many gamers look back up this title as one of their favorite in the series.
                    The era this game took place was a hybrid time frame around the Vietnam War era.
                    With this being my first battlefield game on consoles, my friends and I became the dream squad for each game.
                    We could continously play this game without ever getting bored.  Whether that revolved us rushing to the point on ATVs or circling objects in a Black Hawk, we always enjoyed ourselves.
                    With the upcoming release of Battlefield V, I can only look back and hope it lives up to my favorite battlefield game.

                <h2>Leauge of Legends</h2>
                <p>League of Legends is a DOTA inspired MOBA game that took the world by storm.
                    Starting out from humble beginnings by a studio called Riot Games, they slowly polished the game into what it is today.
                    With over 140+ champions to choose from, the game never get stale.
                    Having been given a unhealthy dose of peer pressure, I finally tried this game my freshman year of college.
                    The game stuck it's addictive claws into the moment I started playing.
                    With the complexity of the game paired with the need for great teamwork, I loved every aspect of this game.
                    For having slowly put so many hours into this game, I have finally put it down for the time being.
                    Even if it isn't in my rotation of games currently, I can't help but to appreciate the amount of fun I had playing it.
